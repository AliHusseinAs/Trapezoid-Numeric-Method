# Trapezoid-Numeric-Method
Trapezoidal Rule for Numerical Integration

The Trapezoidal Rule is a numerical method used to approximate the definite integral of a function. It is based on the idea of approximating the area under a curve using trapezoids.
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:
Simple to implement.
Provides a reasonable approximation for smooth functions.
Disadvantages:
Accuracy depends on the number of subintervals. For highly oscillatory functions, the Trapezoidal Rule may require many subintervals to achieve a good approximation.
